How to Document?
=====================

Documentation has become a central focus of the KGA project, as multiple people work on the project. Sometimes these
people work on it at the same time and sometimes in succession of each other. It is crucial for everyone that the decisions
that are made, are well documented and can be found in one central point. This is were the documentation comes in to play.
Some important aspects need to be discussed in order to keep the documentation central and up to date. Firstly, there are
some decisions with regards to the documentation software and documentation standards. Furthermore, there needs to be proper
documentation on how to create the documentation, to make the process easier for successors. In the section :ref:`Documentation
Standards`, the standards are discussed which are used for the documentation of the KGA project. In the section
:ref:`Documentation with Sphinx`, the process of working with Sphinx to create documentation is described in a lot of detail.
Links to sources with additional information are included throughout the documentation.
